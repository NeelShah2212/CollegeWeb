        <h1>What Does 'Bachelor Of Arts' Mean ? </h1>
        <p class="para">
            A Bachelor of Arts is a college or university degree available in various subjects.
             Each program covers standard general education requirements on liberal arts and humanities topics and then
              allows you to major in a particular specialization of your choice. <br><br>

            The term ‘arts’ can be misleading because, in reality, you can earn a BA degree in a wide range
             of subjects beyond what you might consider art. A BA can prepare you for a career in business, marketing, 
             or health care management, for example.
        </p>
        <h1>How Do You Earn Bachelor Of Arts Degree ?</h1>
        <p class="para">
            Earning your Bachelor of Arts degree typically involves four years of study. You can extend it by choosing to
             study part-time. For the first two years, you generally focus on completing coursework in a range of subjects, 
             including social sciences, humanities, languages, mathematics, sciences, and fine arts, designed to give you 
             a broad foundation of knowledge. <br><br>

            For the final years of study, you'll primarily focus on coursework in your major. Different colleges
             will have different lists of majors, so this also is something to consider when choosing a university.<br><br>

            If you have an interest in two areas, it may be possible to major in both, known as a double major,
             or add a minor, which is a specialization but requires less coursework than your major.<br><br>
