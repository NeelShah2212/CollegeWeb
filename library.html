            An e-library or digital library is a collection of digital resources that are accessible to users via 
            the internet. These resources can include books, articles, journals, research papers, multimedia
            materials, and other types of content. The purpose of an e-library is to provide users, including 
            students looking for the best primary school, with easy and convenient access to a vast array of
            information from anywhere and at any time. E-libraries also provide benefits such as 
            cost-effectiveness, space-saving, and the ability to search and retrieve information quickly 
            and efficiently. They are particularly useful for students, researchers, and professionals who 
            need access to up-to-date information and resources for their work.
