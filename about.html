            education field. It was due to the farsighted vision of eminent lovers of knowledge such as 
            Dr. F.G. Halakatti and Poojya Sangana Basava Swamiji of Banthnal and others. Their philanthropic 
            mission was to propagate education in this educationally and economically backward region. 
            The phenomenal growth and development of  the Association took place under the dynamic leadership of 
            Late Shri B.M. Patil. Presently, the association has witnessed academic excellence by the dedication 
            of Shri M.B. Patil, the President of Association. Today, the Association runs 75 educational institutions
            in all genres of education from Primary level to P.G courses and it embraces Professional and Technical 
            Colleges such  as Medical, Engineering and Pharmacy etc. It has also 1000 bedded hospital and Research 
            Centers in Medical Science and Humanities. The Association has also built a Multi Super Specialty
